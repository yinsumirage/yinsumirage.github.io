I am Guo Wentao, a researcher focusing on robotics and artificial intelligence, with a solid academic foundation and strong engineering practice capabilities. My research interests lie in embodied intelligence, robot control algorithms, and data-driven system optimization, dedicated to solving complex engineering problems through interdisciplinary approaches.

Research Experience
======

Underactuated Hand System Research
------
Led the full-process development of the [Hockens-A Hand](https://yinsumirage.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) project, including mechanical design, control system development, and grasping algorithm validation. Constructed a complete R&D framework from theoretical design to physical implementation, with related results submitted to the top robotics conference IROS. Gained in-depth mastery of the full-cycle research methodology.

Algorithmic Fairness Research
------
Focused on fairness in large model decision-making during the X-institute summer research. Proposed a causal inference-based algorithmic bias detection method through theoretical analysis and experimental verification, exploring the balance between social ethics and data fairness in technological implementation.

Competition
======

Competition Achievements
------
Awarded over 30 times in competitions, including 5 national-level awards as team leader.
1. **Mechanical Innovation & Robotics Competitions**: Led teams for two consecutive years to develop intelligent mechanical vehicles and lidar navigation systems, leading core work in motion control algorithm design and system integration optimization. Accumulated hands-on experience in hardware debugging and multi-sensor fusion.
2. **AI Application Challenges**: Participated in Tianchi AI Competition, power load forecasting projects, and open-source large model application competitions, forming systematic methodologies in data modeling, algorithm deployment, and engineering implementation.


Current Research Focus
======
Currently deeply engaged in embodied intelligence, with research directions including:
1. Fine-grained control algorithm design for dexterous hands
2. Efficient annotation and quality evaluation of embodied data collection based on human behavior videos
3. Exploring the integration of robotic engineering and AI algorithms to promote the practical application of embodied intelligence from theoretical research.

Academic Perspective: Data Challenges and Breakthrough Directions in Embodied Intelligence
======

I believe the core challenge in current embodied intelligence research lies in **data issues**, which can be broken down into two key dimensions:

Paradigm Innovation in Data Collection
------
**Reproducibility Challenges**: Data collected in traditional laboratory environments is highly dependent on variables like lighting and hardware models, limiting reusability. Need to break through the "customized collection" paradigm and explore methods to extract key action features from massive human behavior videos. Draw inspiration from human learning through observation and trial-and-error to reduce reliance on high-precision teleoperation data.

Construction of Data Quality Evaluation Systems
------
**Bias vs. Generalization Conflict**: Data collectors' action habits introduce biases, requiring the establishment of scientific evaluation criteria to identify redundant or low-quality operations. Define core indicators for high-quality data (e.g., action efficiency, environmental adaptability) to guide data collection strategies, avoiding "data piling" approaches and promoting the evolution of embodied intelligence from "data-driven" to "knowledge-guided".
